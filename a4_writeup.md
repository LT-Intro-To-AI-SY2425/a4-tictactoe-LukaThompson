# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The maost difficult part was the start for m because it was hard to visualize how the board should be made and look, the assert also worked even though I made the board wrong which made the other parts nt work

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I could add a computer that could be programmed to either be impossible and make all the correct moves as in if the user goes somewhere, it goes somewhere else to block or I could make  computer that goes on a random space unless it is to block the win. 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
There are not too many actual best moves in tic tac toe as when defending, the best move is always the middle and when starting the best move is the corner so I would make the ot do that.
